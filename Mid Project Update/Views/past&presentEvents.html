         <h2>Air Pollution</h2>

        <h3>Sometimes, air pollution is visible. A person can see dark smoke pour from the exhaust pipes of large trucks or factories, for example. More often, however, air pollution is invisible.

            Polluted air can be dangerous, even if the pollutants are invisible. It can make people’s eyes burn and make them have difficulty breathing. It can also increase the risk of lung cancer.

            Sometimes, air pollution kills quickly. In 1984, an accident at a pesticide plant in Bhopal, India, released a deadly gas into the air. At least 8,000 people died within days. Hundreds of thousands more were permanently injured.</h3>

         <h2>Pollution is the introduction of harmful materials into the environment.</h2>

        <img src="../Asset/p3.jpg" width="500px" height="300px">

        <h3>These harmful materials are called pollutants. Pollutants can be natural, such as volcanic ash. They can also be created by human activity, such as trash or runoff produced by factories. Pollutants damage the quality of      air, water, and land.Many things that are useful to people produce pollution. Cars spew pollutants from their exhaust pipes. Burning coal to create electricity pollutes the air. Industries and homes generate garbage and sewage that can pollute the land and water. Pesticides—chemical poisons used to kill weeds and insects—seep into waterways and harm wildlife.</h3>

        <h3>Every year, millions of tons of plastic enter the oceans, of which the majority spills out from rivers.<br> A portion of this plastic travels to ocean garbage patches, getting caught in a vortex of circulating currents.<br> If no action is taken, the plastic will increasingly impact our ecosystems, health, and economies.</h3>

         <h2>WE AIM TO CLEAN UP 90% OF FLOATING OCEAN PLASTIC POLLUTION</h2>

        <img src="../Asset/o3.jpg" width="500px" height="300px">

        <h3>The Ocean Cleanup is a non-profit organization developing and scaling technologies to rid the oceans of plastic. <br>To achieve this objective, we have to work on a combination of closing the source and cleaning up what has already <br>accumulated in the ocean and doesn’t go away by itself. This goal means we plan to put ourselves out of business – <br>once we have completed this project, our work is done.</h3>
